# Custom Language Compiler

This project aims to develop a compiler for a custom language that generates C language code. The compiler is implemented using PLY in Python, Yacc/Lex in C, or Cup/JFlex in Java.

## Description

The goal of this project is to design a compiler that can process source code written in the custom language and generate equivalent C language code.
